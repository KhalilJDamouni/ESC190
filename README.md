# ESC190
Labs for ESC190: Computer Algorithms and Data Structures

Lab0: Implementation of self-balancing binary search tree to store language statistics from Statistics Canada and US Census.

Lab1: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for path planning for Toronto artworks.

Lab2: Implementation of heaps, alongside various functions, such as getting various value, heapify, heapsort, and finding the most common element.

Lab3: Implementation and use of a stack to create a reverse polish notation (RPN), or postfix, calculator. 

Lab4: Implementation and use of insert, lookup, and delete operation on a hash table, used to store the Social Insurance Numbers (SIN) of a large number of people. Include 3 hash functions alongside 4 types of adressing.
  
  1. Trivial Hash, alongside closed adresssing using chaining.
  
  2. Pearson Hash, alongside open adressing using linear probing.
  
  3. Fibonnaci Hash, alonside open adressing using quadratic probing.
  
  4. Cuckoo Hashing, alonside open adressing.
